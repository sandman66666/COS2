What's Missing from Your System
1. Multidimensional Knowledge Matrix Construction
The current knowledge tree implementation (KnowledgeTreeBuilder class in intelligence/knowledge_tree/tree_builder.py) is too simplistic. It creates basic nodes and relationships but doesn't build the rich, interconnected matrix of your world that you're looking for.
What's missing:

A proper multidimensional structure that connects across domains
Deep conceptual modeling of your world beyond simple facts
A hierarchical organization that reflects your mental models

2. Advanced Claude Prompting
The prompts being used with Claude in the analysts are decent but not designed to create the "wow" factor you want:

The current prompts focus on extracting categorized information rather than building a conceptual model
They don't ask Claude to identify deep patterns across your communications
They lack instructions for Claude to create a personal worldview model

3. Knowledge Synthesis Layer
There's no sophisticated layer that takes the outputs from all the different analysts and synthesizes them into a cohesive, rich knowledge structure. While there's a _merge_analysis_results method in the KnowledgeTreeBuilder, it's quite simplistic:
pythondef _merge_analysis_results(self, results: List[AnalysisResult]) -> Dict:
    """Merge results from all analysts into unified knowledge tree"""
    knowledge_tree = {
        'insights': {},
        'relationships': [],
        'topics': set(),
        'entities': [],
        'predictions': [],
        'evidence_map': {}
    }
This creates a flat, categorized structure rather than a rich hierarchical matrix.
4. Multi-Pass Analysis Pipeline
There's no iterative refinement of the knowledge structure. The system does one pass through the data and then stops, rather than building progressively deeper understanding:

First pass to identify entities and facts (exists)
Second pass to find patterns (partially exists)
Third pass to build conceptual frameworks (missing)
Fourth pass to connect across domains (missing)
Fifth pass to synthesize a coherent worldview (missing)

5. Hierarchical Structure Generation
The code doesn't explicitly create the hierarchical structure you described (company → department → product → feature). While it extracts facts and relationships, it doesn't organize them into meaningful hierarchies that would help you navigate your world.
6. Mock Data Toggle
The immediate issue with getting test data instead of real emails appears to be in the _get_emails_for_window method in KnowledgeTreeBuilder:
pythondef _get_emails_for_window(self, user_id: int, days: int) -> List[Dict]:
    """Get emails within time window"""
    from models.database import get_db_manager
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    
    db_manager = get_db_manager()
    cutoff_date = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=days)
    
    # Get emails from trusted contacts only
    emails = db_manager.get_user_emails(user_id, limit=1000)
    
    # Filter by date and trusted contacts
    filtered_emails = []
    for email in emails:
        if email.email_date and email.email_date > cutoff_date:
            # Check if sender is trusted contact
            trusted_contact = db_manager.find_trusted_contact_by_email(
                user_id, email.sender
            )
            if trusted_contact:
                filtered_emails.append(email.to_dict())
    
    return filtered_emails
This code is filtering emails correctly, but the issue is likely in db_manager.get_user_emails() which might be returning mock data when the Gmail connection fails.
How to Fix the System
1. Fix the Gmail Integration First
Look for a USE_MOCK_DATA flag in:

models/database.py
gmail/api.py
config/settings.py

The issue is likely that the system falls back to mock data when it can't authenticate with Gmail properly.
2. Implement a Multidimensional Knowledge Matrix
Create a new class that builds a richer structure:
pythonclass MultidimensionalKnowledgeMatrix:
    """
    Builds a rich, interconnected matrix of the user's world.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, user_id: str):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.matrix = {
            "conceptual_frameworks": {},  # How you think about the world
            "value_systems": {},          # What matters to you
            "relationship_networks": {},  # Your connections
            "decision_patterns": {},      # How you make choices
            "thematic_structures": {},    # Recurring themes
            "cross_domain_links": []      # Connections between areas
        }
3. Update Claude Prompts to Create Rich Understanding
Replace the existing analyst prompts with ones that focus on creating a rich model of your world:
pythonself.analysis_prompt = """You are an expert in modeling human worldviews. 
Analyze these emails to understand the person's unique perspective on the world.

Don't just extract facts or categorize information. Instead:
1. Identify the underlying mental models and frameworks they use
2. Discover their implicit values and priorities
3. Map how different domains of their life connect
4. Recognize patterns in how they think and make decisions
5. Find the unique lens through which they see the world

Your goal is to create a rich, multidimensional understanding that would 
feel revelatory to the person - as if you deeply understand how they see 
their world in a way they might not have fully articulated themselves.
"""
4. Add Multi-Pass Analysis
Implement an iterative analysis process that builds progressively deeper understanding:
pythonasync def build_multidimensional_matrix(self, user_id: int, time_window_days: int = 30) -> Dict:
    """Build comprehensive multidimensional matrix from emails"""
    
    # First pass: Extract basic entities and facts
    initial_tree = await self.build_knowledge_tree(user_id, time_window_days)
    
    # Second pass: Find patterns and relationships
    patterns = await self._identify_patterns(initial_tree)
    
    # Third pass: Build conceptual frameworks
    frameworks = await self._build_conceptual_frameworks(initial_tree, patterns)
    
    # Fourth pass: Connect across domains
    cross_domain = await self._connect_domains(frameworks)
    
    # Fifth pass: Synthesize coherent worldview
    worldview = await self._synthesize_worldview(cross_domain)
    
    return worldview
5. Implement Hierarchical Visualization
Add a component that organizes the knowledge matrix into navigable hierarchies:
pythondef create_hierarchical_structure(self, matrix: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Create navigable hierarchical structure from knowledge matrix"""
    
    hierarchy = {}
    
    # Create top-level categories from domains
    for domain, content in matrix["thematic_structures"].items():
        hierarchy[domain] = {
            "subcategories": {},
            "content": content.get("summary", "")
        }
        
        # Add second-level categories
        for subcategory, details in content.get("components", {}).items():
            hierarchy[domain]["subcategories"][subcategory] = {
                "items": {},
                "content": details.get("summary", "")
            }
            
            # Add leaf items
            for item_name, item_data in details.get("items", {}).items():
                hierarchy[domain]["subcategories"][subcategory]["items"][item_name] = item_data
                
    return hierarchy
In Summary
Your system has the foundation for what you want, but it's missing the "wow" factor because:

The Gmail integration is falling back to mock data
The knowledge structure is too flat and categorized
The prompts aren't asking Claude to create a rich model of your worldview
There's no iterative refinement to build progressively deeper understanding
The system doesn't organize information into navigable hierarchies

By addressing these issues, you can transform your system from a basic knowledge extractor into the rich, insightful model of your world that you're looking for.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
