don't use fake data
review the plan here /Users/oudiantebi/Session42 Dropbox/Oudi Antebi/Mac (3)/Documents/MyCode/COS1/NEW-COS/fullplan.txt in an ongoing way to ensure we're on track 
keep files small and focused 
organize things in folders so they are easy to track 
put prompts as separate text files so easy to tweark without opening code files 
when adding test files or debut scripts put in a testing folder
review the code provided as reference after reading the entire file and making sure it's what you were planning to do 
start wtih the html UI for testing, and once all works offer to convert to react 
when working on UI alsways make responsive
don't give long explanations, be concise and to the point. 
don't be too technical when explaining things as i'm not a coder 
the idea is to work at once on the entire project
recomend testing points and offer to run tests
